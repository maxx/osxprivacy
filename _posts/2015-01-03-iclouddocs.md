# iCloud unsaved document uploads

<br />

### Explanation

Without any obvious notification to the user, Yosemite will now upload your unsaved content within Apple apps to iCloud. iCloud document storage has been around for a while, but Yosemite is the first release to implement storage of unsaved documents. The result is data *which you might not even intend to save* ending up on Apple (and whatever government entities might be overlooking) servers without your knowledge whatsoever.

<br />

### Solution

 → System Preferences → iCloud → uncheck Documents & Data).

<br />

### Caveat

Currently, there is no known way to avoid syncing unsaved files without disabling all iCloud document functionality.
